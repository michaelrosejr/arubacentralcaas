  push-config     Push json config to group/device.

## Installation

Requires python 3.9+ and pip

### PIP
```
pip install arubacentralcaas
```


### Using Poetry
```
git clone https://github.com/michaelrosejr/arubacentralcaas.git
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### Using venv
```
git clone https://github.com/michaelrosejr/arubacentralcaas.git
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd arubacentralcaas/
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

##Create a config file
Then create the `config.yaml` file in the `$HOME/config` or `$HOME/.config/central/` directory. There's a [`config.yaml.sample`](https://github.com/michaelrosejr/arubacentralcaas/blob/master/arubacentralcaas/config/config.yaml.sample) file to use as a template. The script will default to 'central_info' as the account name if one is not set.

```bash
central_info:
    client_id: "<Your Aruba Central API Client ID>"
    client_secret: "<Client Secret for the specified Client ID>"
    customer_id: "<Aruba Central Customer ID>"
    username: "<Aruba Central Username>"
    password: "<aruba-central-account-password>"
    base_url: "https://central-apigw.central.arubanetworks.com"  # The base of the Aruba Central API GW *for the Cluster you belong to* Starts with https://, ends with arubanetworks.com
```



You can pass the account name using the `--account [account_name]` option. You can also set the environment variable as well: `export ACCOUNT=[account_name]`

Once the config.yaml file has been created, you can then execute the script.

```
caas --help
```

### show accounts
To show the accuonts you setup in `config.yaml`:

```
caas show-accounts
``` 

### show gateways
To show the gateways configured in Aruba Central:

```
caas show-gateways
```

### show commited or effective changes
To show committed or effective changes on the gateway:

```
caas show-committed GROUP_NAME
caas show-committed GROUP_NAME/DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS

caas show-effective GROUP_NAME
caas show-effective GROUP_NAME/DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS
```

### Push a config
Finally to push changes to a Central group or device:
Create a JSON file in the format of:
`example2.json`

```
{
    "cli_cmds": [
        "netdestination test-api-alias",
        "host 1.2.3.4",
        "!",
        "ip access-list session test-api-acl",
        "alias test-api-alias any any permit",
        "!"
    ]
}
```

Then load push the configuration to Aruba Central via this caas CLI:

```
caas push-config sample/example2.json GROUP/00:11:22:33:44:55
```

### Save your output (--save)
The `show-committed` and `show-effective` commands have an option called `--save`, that will save the output into JSON format for you to edit and upload later. This file is located in the `./temp` directory.

## Configuration
There are additioanl configuration located in the `config/settings.py` file as well.
